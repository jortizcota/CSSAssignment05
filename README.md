This week I will be demonstrating my ability to effectively use color. I will be choosing a real company and creating a product launch page that embodies the company’s brand and spirit. You will create a new product and design a page that utilizes the company’s existing logos, colors, etc. If the company you choose has a public style guide, I may use this for inspiration.
